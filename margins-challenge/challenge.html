<p class="p1">The thing was an enormous cave bear, rearing its colossal bulk fully eight feet at the shoulder, while from the tip of its nose to the end of its stubby tail it was fully twelve feet in length.  As it sighted the Sagoths it emitted a most frightful roar, and with open mouth charged full upon them.  With a cry of terror the foremost gorilla-man turned to escape, but behind him he ran full upon his on-rushing companions.</p>

<p class="p2">The horror of the following seconds is indescribable.  The Sagoth nearest the cave bear, finding his escape blocked, turned and leaped deliberately to an awful death upon the jagged rocks three hundred feet below.  Then those giant jaws reached out and gathered in the next&mdash;there was a sickening sound of crushing bones, and the mangled corpse was dropped over the cliff's edge.  Nor did the mighty beast even pause in his steady advance along the ledge.</p>

<p class="p3">Shrieking Sagoths were now leaping madly over the precipice to escape him, and the last I saw he rounded the turn still pursuing the demoralized remnant of the man hunters.  For a long time I could hear the horrid roaring of the brute intermingled with the screams and shrieks of his victims, until finally the awful sounds dwindled and disappeared in the distance.</p>

<p class="p4">Later I learned from Ghak, who had finally come to his tribesmen and returned with a party to rescue me, that the ryth, as it is called, pursued the Sagoths until it had exterminated the entire band.  Ghak was, of course, positive that I had fallen prey to the terrible creature, which, within Pellucidar, is truly the king of beasts.</p>
