On the left, there is an interactive visualization of the box model.

It's made of 4 parts :

1. The top part shows us the box model made of its 4 parts as well as the dimensions of each part.

1. The bottom line : "View mode" allows us to change the view mode from box model to end result. When in "Box model" mode, you can put your mouse over the different parts of the box model to see details. When in "Result" you will just see how the end result would look like considering we have a blue background, a yellow border and a white body background.

1. On the bottom left, you can use the sliders to change these values and see the result in realtime. Try switching between the view modes when you do that.

1. On the bottom right, you can see the resulting css also changing in realtime.

Play it for a while so you can get a sense of how it works ... 

For example you can try putting all the Padding, Margin and Border values to zero and see how only the content is left. Then you can start adding some borders for example.

You might want to click on the little <img class="arrow-inline" src=".guides/img/arrow.png"> icon to have the tool in another browser tab.
