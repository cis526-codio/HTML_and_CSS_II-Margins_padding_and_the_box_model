In the left hand pane, there is an interactive visualization of the box model.

It's made of 4 parts :

1. The top part is the main part and it shows us the box model made of its four parts as well as the dimensions of each part.

1. The bottom line: "View mode" allows us to change the view mode from box model to end result. When in "Box model" mode, you can put your mouse over the different parts of the box model to see details. When in "Result" you will just see how the end result would look like considering we have a blue background, a yellow border and a white page background.

1. On the bottom left: "Properties" allows you to change the values of the different parts, using the sliders, and see the result in real-time. Try switching between the view modes when you do that.

1. On the bottom right: "Resulting CSS" allows you to see the CSS that would be used to produce such a box.

Play it for a while so you can get a sense of how it works ... 

For example, you can try putting all the Padding, Margin and Border values to zero and see how only the content is left. Then, you can start adding some borders ...

You might want to click on the little <img class="arrow-inline" src=".guides/img/arrow.png"> icon to have the tool in a full page in another browser tab.
