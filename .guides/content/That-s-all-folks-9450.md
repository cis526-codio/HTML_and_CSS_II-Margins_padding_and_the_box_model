That's the end of this unit. We have seen the box model, how to use padding and margins to put space around our content and how to give sizes to our elements. We have also seen how to use margins to overlap content as well as centering content in a page.

In the next unit we will continue seeing more ways of positioning and laying out our elements in the page.
