You are asked to modify the style of these three boxes in `style.css` so that the preview at the bottom will look like the second preview `target.html` next to it.\n\nYou can only user `margin` `padding` and `border` and always use the single value version.\nFor the border color, always use `#333333`. Do not change any other styles than the classes `box1` `box2` and `box3` and do not modify the HTML in `index.html` . \n\nIn the target result we have made the margins (normally invisible) look like <img class=\"margin-swatch\" src=\"/.guides/img/margin-swatch.png\">. It is only to help you, so that you can visualize them, in your result the margins will actually be invisible. \n\nIn order to not confuse both previews in the bottom left hand pane, we have given a title \"This is your file\" to your `index.html` file and a title \"This is the target file\" to the result you have to reach.\n\nGood luck !",
